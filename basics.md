# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - I can use this anytime to see the current status of the repository
* `git add <file>` - places the file in the git staging area
* `git commit -m` - commits files to the repository 
* `git diff` - shows differences between an edited file and the commited file?
* `git log` - gives you the log of commits in your repository
